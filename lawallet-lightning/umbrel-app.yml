  The Lightning Module serves as a gateway to the Lightning Network, connecting to an LND instance and providing Lightning Address functionality using LUD-16 for user-friendly payment experiences. This module requires the Core Module to whitelist its pubkey and is responsible for creating inbound and outbound transactions for the BTC token.


  Key features include creating and paying invoices, support for LUD-06, advanced capabilities like NIP-57 Zap Events, and LUD-21 payment verification. By leveraging the Core Moduleâ€™s security framework, the Lightning Module seamlessly integrates Lightning Network functionality for individuals and communities.
